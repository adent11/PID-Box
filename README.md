## PID-Box Project <!--Temporary Title-->
The goal of the PID box project is to control the speed of a motor using a photinterrupter and PID.
## Project Timeline

|Week|Date| Planned Milestones|Actual Progress|
|----| -- | ----------------- |--------|
|1|10/28/19|Design mount for the motor, and the wheel|Designed mount for the motor, the wheel, and a simple t-slot wall|
|2|11/6/19|Design one wall assembly of motor, wheel, and <br/>photointerrupter|Made assembly with the motor, photointerrupter, LCD, some indicator LEDs, and the potentiometer|
|3|11/11/19|Finish designing the box, add in LCD, LED indicators,<br/> switches, battery pack, and potentiometer|Added switches, battery pack, and arduino; 3d printed motor mount|
|4|11/18/19|Add arduino, start assembling box|Started assembling, made fritzing diagram|
|5|12/2/19|Wire everything and get test code working|Mounted all but motor, due to its tendancy to attach crooked, started wiring|

<details><summary><b>Week 5</b></summary>
<p>
  
* Got potentiometer and motor control working with test code
* Broke the wheel trying to put it on
* Made the hole in the wheel slightly wider and recut
* Having trouble attaching the motor and wheel straight
<br/>Behind due to delays in mounting motor
