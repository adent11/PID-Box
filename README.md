## PID-Box Project <!--Temporary Title-->
The goal of the PID box project is to control the speed of a motor using a photinterrupter and PID.
## Project Timeline

|Week|Date| Planned Milestones|Actual Progress|
|----| -- | ----------------- |--------|
|1|10/28/19|Design mount for the motor, and the wheel|Designed mount for the motor, the wheel, and a simple t-slot wall|
|2|11/6/19|Design one wall assembly of motor, wheel, and <br/>photointerrupter|Made assembly with the motor, photointerrupter, LCD, some indicator LEDs, and the potentiometer|
|3|11/11/19|Finish designing the box, add in LCD, LED indicators,<br/> switches, battery pack, and potentiometer|Added switches, battery pack, and arduino; 3d printed motor mount|
|4|11/18/19|Add arduino, start assembling box|Started assembling, made fritzing diagram|
|5|12/2/19|Wire everything and get test code working|Mounted all but motor, due to its tendancy to attach crooked, started wiring|
|6|12/9/19|RPM code|Soldered wires to all of the components, wired all components, assembled box|
|7|1/6/20|PID code|Tested all components, started rpm code, |
|8|1/13/20|Non-PID code|Finished rpm code, started non-PID control code|
|9|1/22/20 |Wrap up loose ends|Finished non-PID control code, wrote PID code, started tuning PID variables|
|10|1/27/20|Delay compensation|Continued tuning PID constants, worked on problem with rpm accuracy|
|11|2/3/20|Delay compensation|Recut wheel, retuned PID constants|

<details><summary><b>Week 4</b></summary>
<p>
  
* Laser cut all walls
* Drilled to fix some holes that were the wrong size
* Recut a wall to have labels
* Started making fritzing diagram
On Schedule

<details><summary><b>Week 5</b></summary>
<p>
  
* Got potentiometer and motor control working with test code
* Broke the wheel trying to put it on
* Made the hole in the wheel slightly wider and recut
* Having trouble attaching the motor and wheel straight
<br/>Behind due to delays in mounting motor 
</p>
</details>
  
<details><summary><b>Week 6</b></summary>
<p>

* Soldered wires to all components
* Finished assembling box
* Note: Leave space for wiring so you don't end up having to cram the wiring into a small box <br/>

<details><summary><b>Week 10</b></summary>
<p>
  
* Continued tuning PID constants
* Came across problem with RPM accuracy due to only having one hole cut in my wheel
</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Week 11</b></summary>
<p>
  
* Redesigned the wheel to have six holes instead of one for greater accuracy
* Retuned PID constants </br>
